- Weekly price change: +5.62% 
- 52-week range: $101.81 - $384.29
- Market capitalization: $565.6 billion
- P/E ratio: 50.05
- Trading volume: 91.6 million shares

Tesla's stock has seen a strong bounce-back recently, up over 5% in the past week and 6.3% today. The company's high market cap of $565 billion and relatively high P/E ratio of 50 indicate that investors have high expectations for Tesla's future growth and profitability. 

However, the stock is still well below its 52-week high of $384, suggesting there may be further upside potential if Tesla can continue executing on its ambitious EV production and technological innovation plans. Monitoring Tesla's delivery numbers, profit margins, and any regulatory/competitive threats will be key for investors going forward.

Overall, Tesla remains an influential and closely-watched stock in the EV and clean energy space. The current financial metrics paint a picture of a highly valued company, but one that will need to continue demonstrating strong performance to justify its premium valuation.‚ùå Error during analysis: Timeout should be used inside a task
